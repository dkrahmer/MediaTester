# MediaTester
MediaTester can test any media (SD, microSD, thumb drives, memory sticks, etc.)
and verify it stores the expected number of bytes. The testing method is similar
to h2testw but MediaTester can detect fake or defective media much faster by
performing quick reads as data is written.

[Download the latest MediaTester for Windows](https://github.com/dkrahmer/MediaTester/releases/latest/download/MediaTester.exe) (Standalone executable - no install required)

Fake media sales have reached epidemic proportions. Fake media is being falsely
labeled with popular brand names including SanDisk, Samsung, Sony, Kingston, and
others. Not only are these counterfeit but often contain less storage than the
cards report to the computer. A 128GB SD card may actually contain only 8GB 
or 4GB of actual space. After filling up all of the real space, the card will
respond as if it is storing the data but it is actually throwing it away. The
files will look like they exist but they are actually full of null bytes or
completely corrupted. If you try to read the data you will find that it is
ALL GONE.

MediaTester is released as a free public service to help stop counterfeiters
and fraudsters. If you buy any storage media, use MediaTester to verify it or
risk losing your data.

The MediaTester library, Windows GUI, and CLI are released under [GNU GPL license](https://github.com/dkrahmer/MediaTester/blob/master/LICENSE).

Enjoy!
